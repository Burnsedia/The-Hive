# Contubuting Code
   C++, Gdscript and Visual Script are the current main languas but Lua and Python are in the Pipline to be added to the codebase.
   Code must fallow the Codding Standards of the Language, GDscript with be Typed in this project but you dont have to use the
   static typing, Just heavalyy profered over dynamic typing for Debug reasons.
   If or when I intergrate Python Scripting in the game It must be as PEP8 complent as posible
   C++ is backword compatable but anything at or above C++ 11 is good

  if you so deeply want to have such stories you can mod them into the game AS MODS not any offical content.
